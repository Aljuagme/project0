    	<h2><li>Administration</li></h2>

<p>The Pine Islands are sometimes grouped together as part of the Balearic Islands, or else considered separate with the Balearics proper being Majorca and Minorca. Politically, they are part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands.</p>

<p>Initially, they were administratively part of the same insular council (of Ibiza and Formentera), but since 2007 they are now separated between the insular council of Ibiza and the insular council of Formentera (each one is also assimilated to a single comarca), which are two of the four main administrative subdivisions of the province (and autonomous community) of the Balearic Islands.</p></ol><br><br>

                <div class="col-md"> <h3>IBIZA</h3><br>

<p>Ibiza is a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea off the eastern coast of Spain. It is 150 kilometres from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. Its highest point, called Sa Talaia, is 475 metres above sea level.</p>

<p>Ibiza has become well known for its association with nightlife, electronic dance music that originated on the island, and for the summer club scene, all of which attract large numbers of tourists drawn to that type of holiday. Several years before 2010, the island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office had been working to promote more family-oriented tourism, with the police closing down clubs that played music at late night hours, but by 2010 this policy was reversed. Around 2015 it was resumed.</p>

<p>Ibiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

<p>Its local cuisine is typically Mediterranean. Of the most common culinary products of the island are sweets known as flaons. Other savory dishes include sofrit pagès, bullit de peix, arròs de matança and arròs a la marinera.</p></div>



		<div class="col-md"><h3>FORMENTERA</h3><br>

		<p>Formentera is the smallest and more southerly island of the Pityusic Islands group which belongs to the Balearic Islands autonomous community.</p>

		<p>The main island of Formentera is 19 kilometres long and is located about 6 kilometres south of Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea. More specifically Formentera is part of the delimitation of the Balearic Sea which is a northwestern element of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

		<p>North of Formentera is the island of Espalmador and is itself surrounded by a few minor islets. Espalmador is a tombolo, separated from the main island of Formentera by a shallow sandbar, and during low tide, it is possible for one to wade between the two islands. This area is a popular stopping point for those in yachts heading between Ibiza and Formentera.</p></div></div></div>
