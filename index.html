    	<h2><li>Introduction</li></h2>

    	<p> The <b>Balearic Islands</b> are an archipelago of Spain, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<p/>
    	<p>There are two groups of islands. The eastern and larger group forms the Balearics proper and includes the principal islands of Majorca and Minorca and the small island of Cabrera. The western group is known as the Pityuses and includes the islands of Ibiza and Formentera</p>
    	<p>The Balearic Islands autonomous community was established by the statute of autonomy of 1983. Palma is the capital as well as the military, judicial, and ecclesiastical centre of the autonomous community. The government encompasses the insular councils of Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera</p>

    	<h2><li>Geography</li></h2>

		<p>The Balearics exhibit a varied terrain, with undulating hills, plateaus, and lowlands. Minorca has extensive plains. Annual precipitation is low, rarely exceeding 450 mm (18 inches), and occurs mainly in the autumn and spring.</p>
		<p>The raids of Barbary pirates discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century. The spread of tourism since the mid-19th century has led to the concentration of population along the coastal areas and the depopulation of the hinterland. The populations of Majorca and Minorca are heavily concentrated in the larger cities, while those of the islands of Ibiza and Formentera tend to be dispersed</p>
		<p>Emigration from the hinterland has sharply reduced the agricultural workforce in the islands. The traditional Mediterranean crops of wheat, grapes, and olives predominated until 1830, when improved transport allowed new cash crops to be taken to more-distant markets. These included almonds, peaches, apricots, carob, and tomatoes. Dry farming predominates, though the waterwheels and windmills that were introduced by the Muslims for irrigation persist. Sir Richard Kane, governor of Minorca between 1712 and 1736, introduced cattle and sheep from North Africa and pigs from Sardinia; these breeds continue to be raised.</p>
		<p>Manufacturing is of relatively little importance, and most establishments have few employees. Manufactures include shoes, furniture, and textiles. Fine lace and embroidery are made for tourists. Tourism, which dominates the economy, offers only seasonal employment, with much of the workforce idle during the winter.</p>
    	
    	<h2><li>Climate</li></h2>

		<p>Located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, the Balearic Islands unsurprisingly have typical Mediterranean climates. The below-listed climatic data of the capital Palma are typical for the archipelago, with minor differences to other stations in Majorca, Ibiza, and Minorca.</p>

		<h2><li>History</li></h2>

		<p>Varied civilizations have left their marks on the islands, the prehistoric Talayotic civilization has historical evidences of at least 2,600 years of settlement, the islands were successively ruled by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Moors, and Spaniards, all of whom have left their mark.</p>
		<p>Around 461 AD, the Vandals conquered the islands, and then, in early 534, the troops of Belisarius (Byzantine Empire) gained control.</p>
		<p>The islands became a popular point for pirates in 902, and a shift of power in the Iberian peninsula rendered the islands vulnerable.</p>
		<p> James I of Aragon conquered the islands of Majorca and Ibiza between 1229 and 1235, and Minorca fell to his descendant, Alfonso III, in 1287. The Balearics were established as an autonomous kingdom in 1298 and rejoined Aragon in 1349.</p>
		<p>In 1469, Ferdinand II of Aragon (king of Aragon) and Isabella I of Castile (queen of Castile) were married. After their deaths, their respective territories (until then governed separately) were governed jointly, in the person of their grandson, the Emperor Charles V. This can be considered the foundation of the modern Spanish state, albeit a decentralised one wherein the various component territories within the united crowns retained their particular historic laws and privileges.</p>
		<p>The Balearic Islands were frequently attacked by Barbary pirates from North Africa; Formentera was even temporarily abandoned by its population. In 1514, 1515 and 1521, the coasts of the Balearic Islands and the Spanish mainland were raided by Turkish privateers</p><p>The island of Minorca was a British dependency for most of the 18th century as a result of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. This treaty signed by the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Portugal as well as the Kingdom of Spain, to end the conflict caused by the War of the Spanish Succession gave Gibraltar and Minorca to the Kingdom of Great Britain, Sardinia to Austria (both territories had been part of the Crown of Aragon for more than four centuries), and Sicily to the House of Savoy. In addition, Flanders and other European territories of the Spanish Crown were given to Austria. The island fell to French forces, under Armand de Vignerot du Plessis in June 1756 and was occupied by them for the duration of the Seven Years' War.</p>
		<p>Minorca was finally returned to Spain by the Treaty of Amiens during the French Revolutionary Wars, following the last British occupation, which lasted from 1798 to 1802. The continued presence of British naval forces, however, meant that the Balearic Islands were never occupied by the French during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
